# Landing page media

The landing page story (`components/cinematic/`) is built from one photo per chapter. Each photo is
listed in `components/cinematic/chapters.ts`; a chapter without a photo is left out of the story
automatically, so adding a photo is all it takes to switch a chapter on.

## Photos in use (`public/cinematic/`)

The Canva images are 1680x944, the Figma images 1376x768; all are JPG between 150 and 470 KB. They are served through the Next.js image optimiser
(`next/image` and `photoUrl()` in `chapters.ts`), which resizes them per screen and converts them to
WebP/AVIF, so visitors never download the originals. These are generated images, not photos of real
BuildX suppliers or sites, and they contain no brand names or logos.

## Adding or replacing a chapter photo
To add or replace one: save a landscape photo (at least 1600 px wide, 16:9) as `public/cinematic/<file>`, set
`photo: '/cinematic/<file>'` (and optionally `focus`) on that chapter in `chapters.ts`. Use only images BuildX generated, owns, or has a
licence for, and note the source in the tables above. No other brands' photos, logos or copy.

## Optional upgrade: filmed footage
A real hero clip (site at golden hour, 8-12 s seamless loop, 720p, under 3 MB, H.264 + VP9, no audio)
can replace the hero photo later. Keep the photo as its poster and for phones and reduced motion.
