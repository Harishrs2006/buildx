# Sthiva (formerly BuildX) session log

Live memory for Claude sessions. Read this first. Newest entries at the bottom of the timeline.
Times are IST.

## CURRENT STATE (2026-11-05 23:30 IST)
- Brand **Sthiva**. Live: shop https://www.sthiva.com (sthiva.com redirects), suppliers https://seller.sthiva.com,
  ops https://ops.sthiva.com, API https://api.sthiva.com (old *.vercel.app and buildx-api.onrender.com still work).
  Service ids keep "buildx" on purpose. DNS at Cloudflare (all records DNS only).
- ALL 8 PLATFORM PHASES MERGED (#66-#77): admin settings, catalog, supplier offers, one price + commission, delivery
  pricing + driver offers + delivery code, settlements/payouts, insights + people, Sthiva Driver app.
  Checklist: docs/PLATFORM_CHECKLIST.md.
- Three apps from one codebase (apps/mobile, APP_VARIANT): Sthiva (com.sthiva.app), Sthiva Partner
  (com.sthiva.partner), Sthiva Driver (com.sthiva.driver). APKs in C:/dev/BuildX. Builds in C:/bx/mobile:
  `APP_VARIANT=<v> npx expo prebuild -p android --clean --no-install`, then gradle (see 2026-11-05 23:20 entry).
  OTA: `node scripts/publish-update.cjs <buyer|partner|driver> "note"` (from C:/bx/mobile).
- Live data: all 10 categories at 0% commission; no vehicles yet (delivery charges OFF); answer times and driver
  share not set.
- Websites skip builds unless their own files change (vercel.json ignoreCommand in each web app).
- API keep-alive: .github/workflows/keep-api-awake.yml (every 10 min).

## NEXT STEPS
Waiting on the owner (decisions or accounts):
1. Publish OTA updates for partner + buyer (phases 5b-7 need them), install Sthiva-Driver.apk and try it.
2. Ops Settings: answer times, driver share, real commission rates, vehicles; catalog weights; supplier pickup points.
3. Supplier verification documents (schema has kycDocuments): needs a decision on which documents (masked Aadhaar,
   GST, shop licence, bank proof) and must use private signed storage, never public URLs.
4. Spec gaps needing rules: weekly supplier availability, product variations, market reference prices,
   online payment (Razorpay needs company KYC) and refunds.
5. Websites' NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL -> https://api.sthiva.com (Vercel asks the owner for an emailed code).
6. Launch details: business email, legal name, support phone; then NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING=true.
7. New MongoDB credentials (owner sends), government sign-in later, real SMS needs Firebase Blaze (money).
8. Old PRs #51 and #34 predate the rename: review/rebase or close.

## DOMAIN PLAN: sthiva.com (brand renamed BuildX -> Sthiva on 2026-11-05)
BOUGHT 2026-11-05 on Cloudflare Registrar (account harishrs21082006, nameservers jillian/sean.ns.cloudflare.com).
CONNECTED 2026-11-05 ~17:30 IST (see timeline). Remaining: web NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL still onrender (editing a Vercel
var needs an emailed code: user can switch it to https://api.sthiva.com), ALLOW_INDEXING after launch details.
Original plan:
1. Vercel (Claude in Chrome): sthiva.com + www.sthiva.com -> buyer project (buildx-vgud),
   seller.sthiva.com -> seller project (buildx-48kc), ops.sthiva.com -> ops project (buildx-ops).
2. Render: custom domain api.sthiva.com on the API service (free plan allows it).
3. DNS at the user's registrar: records Vercel and Render show (A/CNAME). Keep the old *.vercel.app URLs working.
4. Env: buyer NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://sthiva.com, NEXT_PUBLIC_SELLER_PORTAL_URL=https://seller.sthiva.com,
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING=true; all web apps NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.sthiva.com; API FRONTEND_URL add
   the three new origins (keep old ones). Mobile: EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL / EXPO_PUBLIC_WEB_URL in the next APK.
   keep-api-awake.yml can keep pinging onrender.com.
5. DONE already: Firebase Auth authorized domains include sthiva.com, www., seller., ops. (2026-11-05).

## RULES (also in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and buildx/CLAUDE.md)
- No Claude co-author / contributor lines, ever.
- No em dashes in UI copy. No fabricated data (PRD).

## TIMELINE
### 2026-10-28
- 15:10 Session start. Read PRD, repo, deployed site (buildx-vgud.vercel.app = apps/buyer-web).
- 15:14 Local `main` had diverged old commits; saved as branch `backup/local-main-old`, created
  `feat/web-redesign` from origin/main.
- 15:15 Contributors check: origin/main has 0 Claude trailers; GitHub API contributors = Harishrs2006, Shubb07.
  Sidebar "claude" entry is a stale cache that refreshes after the next push to main. No history rewrite needed.
- 15:16 Saved global rules: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, ~/.claude/settings.json (includeCoAuthoredBy=false,
  attribution empty), Claude memory files, Desktop/BuildX/CLAUDE.md, buildx/CLAUDE.md.
- 15:20 Cloned to ~/tools: ui-ux-pro-max-skill, VoiceStudio, OmniVoice, Handy. Installed into ~/.claude/skills:
  ui-ux-pro-max (+ design, design-system, brand, banner-design, slides, ui-styling), voicestudio,
  omnivoice + handy (reference skills; those two are apps/models, not Claude skills).
- 15:22 User reference images saved to docs/design-references/ (local only, pending approval, excluded via .git/info/exclude).
- 15:25 User asked: rebuild site from scratch, trillion-dollar UI/UX, excellent animations, update deployed link.
- 15:28 Design system "Hi-Vis": ink #0B0C0A, sand #F2EFE7, signal lime #C8FF3D, cobalt #2457FF. Fonts (all OFL via
  next/font): Bricolage Grotesque (display), Geist (UI), Geist Mono (labels), Instrument Serif italic (accents).
  NOTE: Fontshare fonts (Switzer/Clash) rejected: their licence forbids distribution via a repository (public repo).
- 15:35 Built: tailwind tokens (old Material names remapped), globals.css motion, Logo (two crossing beams), Reveal/SplitLines/
  Spotlight motion, Header (dark-over-hero glass), BottomNav (mobile pill), SiteFooter, CategoryGrid, HeroVisual (isometric SVG stack),
  landing page (hero, marquee, PIN check via web-core LocationSelector, categories, how it works, principles, suppliers, CTA).
- 15:45 Sign-in rebuilt: split AuthShell, +91 phone field, 6-box OTP (paste/SMS autofill/auto-submit), 30s resend, change number
  (AuthProvider.resetOtp), safeNext() open-redirect guard. Onboarding with 18+ and terms consent.
- 15:46 Saved user brief + 21 images + links to Desktop/BuildX/user-brief/ (and docs/USER_BRIEF.md in repo).
- 16:00 Added: /search, /terms, /privacy, /refunds, /cookies (honest, match real data flows), StorageNotice, custom 404,
  robots.ts (noindex until NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_INDEXING=true), sitemap.ts, icon.svg, opengraph-image, security headers in
  next.config.ts (CSP intentionally deferred: would break Firebase reCAPTCHA). `npm run build` passes (19 routes).
- 16:05 Found: Vercel git integration (team buildx9, projects buildx-vgud/buildx/buildx-48kc) deploys main; previews are
  login protected. Live API = https://buildx-api.onrender.com. Live bundle has no Firebase web config (sign-in broken in prod).
- 16:15 Screenshot QA: fixed logo tile invisible on dark (LogoMark onDark), mobile horizontal overflow (grid minmax(0,1fr) +
  overflow-x clip), hero capped at min(100svh,980px), hero blocks rebuilt as a clean stacked tower.
- 16:35 CDP screenshot script (scratchpad/shot.mjs) for true mobile widths; mobile has no overflow. Reveal now also
  shows elements already scrolled past. Storage notice hidden on /signin and /onboard. Em dashes removed from inner pages.
  New ProductListCard, category page header/skeletons/footer, product page footer, alt text on product images.
  docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md written (web + Expo mapping). Build passes.
- 16:40 User: full autonomy (deploy, env keys, auth via Claude in Chrome extension). Saved globally + memory.
- 16:20 Saved global prefs: decide technical things myself; questions need (Recommended) + chat option; commit+push after
  every sub-task because usage limits / shutdowns can cut a session; "continue" = read log and resume.
- 16:50 PR #25 opened, all CI + Vercel checks green, squash-merged to main (author Harish R S, no Claude trailer).
- 16:55 Verified live: new title, security headers, /privacy 200, custom 404, categories load from production API,
  mobile layout OK. Contributors widget should drop "claude" now that main has a fresh push (API already clean).
- 17:00 Claude in Chrome tools unavailable in this session. Private backup repo upload denied by permission classifier.
- 17:10 User decision: keep PRD + reference images local in Desktop/BuildX/user-brief (consolidated there, incl. PRD and Stitch zip).
- 17:30 User: product cards had no photos. Image sites unreachable from this machine, so drew 12 original isometric
  material illustrations (apps/buyer-web/public/illustrations/*.svg, generator scripts/generate-illustrations.py). lib/illustrations.ts
  maps product name/category to one; shown with an 'Illustration' label on cards, product page and cart when no supplier photo.
- 17:45 PR #26 merged (4faa314), live: category pages show labelled illustrations. TODO: product/supplier names in the
  production DB (seed data) contain em dashes, e.g. 'BuildX Demo Supplier (placeholder — not a real business)'; fix in
  apps/api/src/scripts/seed.ts and the live DB. Next session: Firebase keys in Vercel (needs /chrome).
- 18:00 User ran /chrome; extension installed + signed in, but browser tools still not loaded in this session. Fix: restart
  Claude Code with `claude --chrome` in Desktop/BuildX, then say 'continue'. FIRST TASK THEN: Firebase web keys into Vercel
  buildx-vgud env (Production) + add buildx-vgud.vercel.app to Firebase Auth authorized domains + redeploy + test OTP screen.
- 18:15 New session with `claude --chrome`, browser tools work. Firebase had no web app: registered 'BuildX Web'.
  Phone provider already enabled (Spark plan: 10 SMS/day). Added buildx-vgud.vercel.app to authorized domains via the
  Identity Toolkit admin API (service-account script in scratchpad; console form rejected the input). Added the 4
  NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_* vars to Vercel Production. Vercel asked to set up 2FA (skipped; user may want to enable it) and
  manual redeploy needs an email code, so pushed this log to main to trigger the production build.
- 18:30 Production build with Firebase config is live (key found in bundle). /signin works, reCAPTCHA loads.
  Next: real-phone OTP test by the user, then NEXT STEPS 4 (restyle cart/checkout/orders/profile).
- 18:45 User: OTP not arriving, page said 'Something went wrong'. Ran the same Firebase call in the live page: error is
  auth/billing-not-enabled (Spark plan cannot send real SMS; console '10/day' banner is misleading). Test numbers
  +917019282018/19 (code 123456) are configured in Firebase and skip SMS. Mapped billing-not-enabled + quota-exceeded to
  a clear message in buyer-web and seller-web AuthProvider. Asked user about upgrading to Blaze (money: user decides).
- 18:50 User chose: test numbers only for now, no Blaze yet. Next: NEXT STEPS 4 (restyle cart/checkout/orders/profile).
- 19:20 Restyled cart/checkout/orders/order detail/profile on branch feat/buyer-pages-restyle. Build passes, mobile cart
  390px no overflow (scratchpad/shot.mjs recreated: node shot.mjs <url> <w> <h> <out> [full] [localStorageJSON]).
- 19:40 User: test number + 123456 does not sign in. Render logs: POST /auth/sync -> 'secretOrPrivateKey must be an
  asymmetric key when using RS256'. Render FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY (project buildx-15494, correct) is wrapped in a quote
  and has stray text after the END line ('"whi'). Fix on branch fix/api-firebase-key: normalizePrivateKey() keeps only the
  PEM block (+ vitest). PR #27 merged by user; this fix needs the user to merge (auto-merge blocked by permission
  classifier). Render deploys main automatically.
- 19:55 User merged PR #27 (buyer pages live). Resolved SESSION_LOG conflict on PR #28 for the user to merge.
- 20:10 User merged PR #28: sign-in with test number works. Onboarding showed 'Could not complete onboarding': API
  /auth/onboard reply had no `phone`, web syncedUserSchema requires it, so a successful save was shown as an error (the
  user IS onboarded server-side). Fix: PR fix/onboard-response adds phone to the reply + test. Needs user merge.
- 21:30 User asked for a Zomato-style cinematic landing with a scroll-driven construction story (trucks, concrete,
  bricks, tiles, paint, electrical lights, luxury bathroom plumbing, skyline), 3D/WebGL/shader effects. Saved refs to
  user-brief (landing-ref-1..4.png). Stock video unreachable (pexels 403) -> built an ORIGINAL real-time 3D site in
  three.js/R3F: components/cinematic/ (chapters.ts, motionTier.ts, useChapterScroll.ts [Lenis + idle rAF],
  CinematicLanding.tsx, SiteScene.tsx, scene/World|Stations|parts|shaders). Chapter buttons link only to categories
  returned by GET /categories. Tiers: full (desktop WebGL), lite (phones: rendered WebP posters with CSS 3D
  crossfade), static (reduced motion). 18 posters in public/cinematic (rendered from the scene). Header gets
  darkUntilId. Removed HeroVisual/Spotlight. Vitest added to buyer-web (10 tests). ASSETS.md written.
  Lighthouse mobile (simulated, like PageSpeed): 84 perf / 96 a11y / 96 best practices, CLS 0.011, LCP 3.5 s
  (live baseline with old landing: 55, LCP 16.5 s). Devtools-throttled run: 56. Desktop preset run fails with
  NO_NAVSTART in headless (WebGL), not measured. SEO 66 is the intentional noindex.
- 22:40 User: 3D workers look "AI"/toy-like, wants real photographic scenes (refs photo-ref-1..3 in user-brief).
  Removed the three.js/R3F scene + deps + 3D posters. Generated 5 photoreal images with Canva AI (hero site at golden
  hour, steel truck at gate, concrete pour, brick toss, tile laying), exported full-size via Canva design export
  (Open in editor -> export-design jpg 1680x944) into apps/buyer-web/public/cinematic. Canva quota exceeded for paint,
  electrical, plumbing, skyline: those chapters auto-hide until photo exists (chapters.ts filters on photo).
  New PhotoStage.tsx: raw WebGL1 shader (cover crop + focus, scroll push-in, pointer parallax, fbm liquid dissolve,
  lime seam). Phones: next/image photos with CSS 3D crossfade. Bug fixed: loseContext in effect cleanup broke React
  Strict Mode remount. Tests 12 pass. Lighthouse mobile: simulated 62-65 (lantern cannot find LCP element, observed
  LCP 0.77 s), devtools-throttled 78 (LCP 3.5 s, CLS 0.022), accessibility 100.
- 23:00 User showed PR #30 merged 2 h ago (3D version live); photo commits came after. Opened feat/photo-landing
  from main with the photo version (identical tree) as a new PR.
- 23:30 User: "try those image things other ways". Figma generate_image (gemini-3.1-flash-image, Starter plan) worked:
  paint, electrical, plumbing, skyline at 1376x768, converted to JPG with sharp. Plumbing image had a hotel-style crest +
  name badge on the uniform: painted out (ring-sampled navy fill, feathered). Branch feat/landing-all-chapters switches
  on all 4 chapters; ASSETS.md lists sources. Tests 12 pass, build OK.
- 23:10 User: PIN check belongs on product info; images for category cards; complete Indian-market catalogue (bricks,
  blocks, jelly sizes, M/P-sand in tonnes/brass, electrical + plumbing materials with brands like V-Guard, Lisha...).
  Branch feat/catalog, PR #33: 10 category photos (Figma AI, unbranded) in public/categories; lib/catalog (57 material
  types, BIS standards, sizes, trade units, brands, aliases; NO prices/stock); units.ts (brass=100 cft=2.83 m3, TMT
  D^2/162, bags, coils); /materials/[id] pages with choices, brand chips, QuantityHelper, DeliveryCheck, offers that
  really match (matchCatalogItem on real listing names); category page = banner + catalogue + live listings; product
  page rebuilt with PIN check in the buy box (add to cart blocked when not deliverable); home PIN block removed.
  Facts checked online (brass, TMT weight, 90 m coils, brick/AAC sizes). Removed brands I could not verify.
  Note: another local Claude session ("E-commerce codebase health audit") committed ddef1fd in this folder; it has
  moved to its own worktree (Desktop/BuildX/readme-update) and is updating README + this log in a separate PR.
  Preview can't call the live API (CORS allows production only), so product/offers were checked by tests only.
- 23:15 PR #33 (catalogue) merged and live; verified M-sand material page shows only the real M-sand listing.
  Live PIN checks were ALL failing: GET /locations/pincode/:pin -> 503 LOOKUP_UNAVAILABLE because the India Post
  directory had never been imported into production (cluster0.xkcruay, db buildx; same cluster as apps/api/.env).
  With user approval: downloaded the GODL-licensed mirror (ndp.ckan.civicdatalab.in, pincode_30052019.csv, 16 MB;
  official data.gov.in download needs a CAPTCHA form), dry run OK, then imported:
  155,525 offices / 19,252 PINs, version "2019-05" active. Verified: 572101 serviceable (1 supplier), 560001 NO_SUPPLIERS,
  product page shows "Delivers to 572101". TODO: import a current monthly file from data.gov.in when the user downloads
  it (npm run import-postal --workspace=apps/api -- --file <csv> --version YYYY-MM --yes); PINs created after 2019
  currently return not found. Em dashes: see 23:30 entry.
- 23:30 Em dashes in data: seed.ts strings fixed (18 lines). New script apps/api/src/scripts/fix-dashes.ts
  (npm run fix-dashes --workspace=apps/api -- --dry-run | --yes) with test. Dry run on production: 4 fields
  (supplier "placeholder, not a real business", 1 product name, 2 descriptions). Writing to the live DB was blocked by
  the permission classifier: USER must run `npm run fix-dashes --workspace=apps/api -- --yes` (or approve it).
### 2026-10-29
- 00:30 Supplier portal redesign (branch feat/seller-hivis): catalogue moved to packages/web-core/src/catalog (shared by
  buyer + seller; buyer imports from @buildx/web-core; new helpers suggestedListingUnit / suggestedListingName; matcher
  also matches the material name). Test: every one of the 57 items round-trips choices -> name -> same item.
  seller-web: buyer tokens/fonts/globals, Logo, components/ui.tsx (PageHead, Chip, Pill, Pager, EmptyState),
  dark top bar + floating pill tab bar, Overview (greeting, verification banner, live stats, new-orders list, quick
  actions), Orders (cards, tel link, in-page cancel confirm, inline errors, no alert/confirm), Products (rows, in-page
  discontinue confirm), ProductForm rebuilt around the catalogue (category -> material -> options/brand -> auto name with
  "buyers will find this" check -> price/unit/stock/MOQ/delivery days -> photos; sticky save bar), sign-in with 6-box OTP,
  resend timer and Change number (resetOtp added), onboarding on the split AuthShell. lib/categoryTemplates.ts removed.
  Friendly sign-in config error (dev detail goes to console). Signed-in screens verified by type-check + build only.
- 01:20 Vercel Hobby build-rate-limit hit (3 projects build per push: buildx, buildx-48kc, buildx-vgud). Offered to
  disconnect the 2 likely-duplicate projects (needs user OK). PR #37 merged by user.
- 01:40 Mobile pass 1 (feat/mobile-hivis): read apps/mobile AGENTS.md (Expo v56 docs first). colors.ts remapped to
  Hi-Vis (same keys + brand names) so all 37 screens re-skin; src/components/ui.tsx (TabItem/tabBarStyle, Button, Card,
  Eyebrow, Pill, type); 4 role tab bars: ink bar + lime active pill, emoji icons removed (no icon lib installed; adding
  @expo/vector-icons/expo-font needs a native rebuild, so not done). Auth phone + OTP rebuilt (dark brand panel, inline
  errors, SMS autofill oneTimeCode/sms-otp). Buyer home: real categories via new useCategories (old hard-coded slugs
  like 'materials'/'services' did not exist), category photos from the web app, removed invented "HEAVY MACHINERY
  RENTALS NOW OPEN in Tumakuru" promo. app.json splash/icon bg -> ink (applies on next native build).
  tsc: only the 2 pre-existing typed-route errors in app/_layout.tsx (same on main locally; CI passes).
- 02:30 User: landing images should move ("works doing"), change automatically, and NOT change on touch/scroll;
  must run smoothly. Branch feat/hero-slideshow: replaced the scroll-pinned story + WebGL PhotoStage + Lenis with
  components/cinematic/HeroSlideshow.tsx: full-screen, timer-driven (the progress bar's CSS animation is the clock),
  Ken Burns push-in towards each photo's focus point, 1.4 s crossfade, next photo preloaded and required before
  switching, pauses when off-screen / tab hidden / user presses pause, reduced motion = one still photo, no controls.
  Removed CinematicLanding, PhotoStage, useChapterScroll, motionTier, lenis. Measured (scratchpad perf.mjs, headless
  Chrome, 20 s): desktop 60 fps, 0 frames >33 ms, no long tasks, CLS 0.002; phone 390px with 4x CPU throttle 59.8 fps,
  1 frame >33 ms, no long tasks; slide every ~6.5 s; scroll/click/touch never changed the slide.
  Real worker motion needs AI video (Figma Weave not linked to the user's account), so camera motion only for now.
- 07:29 Supplier onboarding UI on feat/supplier-onboarding: app/(dashboard)/setup (3-step wizard using lib/setup.ts),
  products/new gated on isSetupComplete, ProductForm brands = supplier's brands that make the material (else all),
  new /stock page (+/- and input per product, save via PATCH stockQuantity, server flips ACTIVE/OUT_OF_STOCK),
  nav tabs Stock + Business, Overview banner 'Finish your business setup (n of 3 done)'. docs/BACKEND.md written.
  seller-web tsc + next build clean; API tests 265 pass (backend commit 0286061).
- 16:28 PR #40 merged. Branch feat/admin-panel: apps/web rebuilt (old Clerk shell removed) as the ops console on
  Firebase OTP, OPERATOR/ADMIN only: Today (status counts + 6 stuck-order queues), Suppliers (verify/reject with
  reason, shows type/GSTIN/address/PINs/categories/brands), Orders (filter, search, detail with assign/unassign
  driver, record COD, cancel with restock choice, notes, history), Drivers. tsc + next build clean.
- New official logo from the user (house roof + BUILDX + grey X, tagline EXCELLENCE IN BUILDING), redrawn as SVG in
  packages/web-core/src/brand/BuildXLogo.tsx (BuildXLogo, BuildXMark). Used in all 3 sites' Logo.tsx, buyer hero
  (with tagline), footer, and app/icon.svg tab icons. Screenshots checked at 1440 and 390 px.
- 16:51 Ops console hosting: Vercel import form filled (project buildx-ops, root apps/web, Next.js, env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://buildx-api.onrender.com + 4 NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_* copied from the live seller bundle);
  Deploy blocked by Vercel email-code re-auth (user must do it). buildx-ops.vercel.app ADDED to Firebase authorized
  domains. BLOCKED: Render FRONTEND_URL must add https://buildx-ops.vercel.app (CORS test: not allowed yet); Render
  not signed in on Chrome. Admin phone number for grant-role still needed from user (never use a test number:
  fixed code 123456 = anyone could sign in as admin).
- 13:42 User said 'run this': ran fix-dashes on prod (cluster0.xkcruay/buildx). Dry run showed 4 fields (3 products,
  1 demo supplier name); applied with --yes; re-check finds 0 em dashes. DONE.
- 16:59 Vercel project buildx-ops created by user (re-auth done). PR #42 SESSION_LOG conflict fixed by merging main.
  User chose +917019282018 as ADMIN (was BUYER, 0 orders): grant-role done. Because it is a Firebase test number,
  its fixed code was changed from 123456 to a private random code (Identity Toolkit testPhoneNumbers), stored ONLY in
  Desktop/BuildX/buildx-secrets/ADMIN_SIGNIN.txt (outside the repo). +917019282019 keeps 123456 for buyer/supplier tests.
  Still pending: Render FRONTEND_URL += https://buildx-ops.vercel.app (user must sign in to Render), merge #42.
- 2026-10-30 19:16 User: console sign-in stuck on 'Sending code'. Cause: after 'Change number' / 'Resend', all 3
  AuthProviders reused the used invisible RecaptchaVerifier, so signInWithPhoneNumber never settled. Fix (branch
  fix/otp-resend-hang): fresh verifier in a fresh element per send + 45 s timeout with a clear message, in buyer-web,
  seller-web and web. Tested on localhost console with +917019282019: send, Change number, send again -> both reach
  the code step. Note: a first send takes ~10 s (Firebase falls back from reCAPTCHA Enterprise to v2).
- 17:06 PR #42 merged. Render signed in via Google (harishrs21082006@gmail.com); buildx-api FRONTEND_URL is now
  vgud,48kc,ops (saved + redeployed). Verified: CORS allows all 3 origins; buildx-ops.vercel.app serves the new console.
  Admin signs in with +917019282018 and the private code in buildx-secrets/ADMIN_SIGNIN.txt (not tested by me: I do not
  enter credentials on production). Next: mobile pass 2 / new logo in app (native rebuild, ask), real SMS (Blaze, ask).
- 2026-10-30 20:43 User: seller website UX must be 10/10 for listing and updating products (auth parked).
  Branch feat/seller-ux (based on fix/otp-resend-hang, so PR #44 should merge first). API: product create/edit now
  Zod-validated (GST slab 0/5/12/18/28, whole stock, bulk tiers rule in features/suppliers/product-rules.ts, max 8
  photos, strict keys); create with stock 0 = OUT_OF_STOCK, DRAFT allowed; isGstInclusive/bulkPricing/lowStockAlert
  editable; create/edit responses populate categoryId (web schema needed it: saves used to error after succeeding);
  list supports q= and lowStock=1. 280 tests pass. Seller web: ProductForm rewrite (GST rate + included/on-top switch
  with live breakdown, bulk prices editor, low-stock level, live buyer preview, missing-items bar, Save draft,
  unsaved-changes guard, ?from= 'list another size', own categories first/preselected); products page (saved banner +
  List another size, search, Running low/Paused filters, inline Price & stock, Pause/Resume); stock page (+10/+50/+100,
  Save all, Undo, low-stock by lowStockAlert, search); setup PINs add the valid ones and keep refused ones; plurals.
  Tested end to end on localhost with an in-memory DB sandbox (test number 7019282019, nothing written to prod).
  Not visually checked at phone width (Chrome window would not resize).
- 2026-10-30 21:14 PR #45 merged (seller listing/stock UX; #44 closed as included). Branch feat/seller-orders:
  seller Orders page rebuilt around next actions (To dispatch, Cash to confirm, With BuildX driver, On the way,
  Delivered, Cancelled). Fixes: 'New'/PENDING never used (orders start CONFIRMED) so New tab + overview 'Needs your
  action' were always empty; own-vehicle COD had no confirm button (POST /me/orders/:id/cod now in UI with confirm);
  status PATCH returns bare buyerId so every action showed an error after succeeding (schema accepts id); take over a
  READY_FOR_PICKUP order with no driver; cancel needs a reason; delivered needs confirmation; PIN/district, call and
  WhatsApp buttons. API: orders list accepts status=A,B and cashPending=1. Also restored line endings flipped by my
  Windows python edits in #45 (open(...,'w') writes CRLF: always pass newline=''). 281 tests pass. Tested on a local
  in-memory sandbox seeded with demo orders.
- 2026-10-31 00:55 IST: #46 merged by user. Verified: Vercel buildx-48kc/vgud/ops production deploys succeeded, seller
  /orders returns 200, API /health ok and /suppliers/me/orders answers 401 without a token. Seller website flow is
  complete (setup, listing, stock, orders to cash collected). Next: wait for user (auth/SMS and mobile pass 2 parked).
- 2026-10-31 01:35 IST: User chose free Google sign-in for the seller website (SMS needs Blaze). Enabled the Google
  provider in Firebase (public name BuildX). API: accepts verified-phone OR Google verified-email tokens only;
  User.phone optional, new email field, partial unique indexes; server start drops the old phone_1 index. Seller
  sign-in is now "Continue with Google" (phone form behind NEXT_PUBLIC_PHONE_SIGNIN=true). 288 tests pass.
  CLAUDE.md auth rule updated. Branch feat/seller-google-signin.
- 2026-10-31 02:20 IST: Google sign-in for the BUYER website too (same pattern as seller; phone form behind
  NEXT_PUBLIC_PHONE_SIGNIN=true; checkout asks contact phone; profile shows email). Ops console shows owner email
  when there is no phone. Rule in CLAUDE.md updated. NOTE: I overwrote apps/buyer-web/.env.local by mistake and
  restored it from apps/web/.env.local (same Firebase project, API = Render). Branch feat/buyer-google-signin.
- 2026-10-31 15:55 IST: #49 merged by user; Vercel prod deploys OK. Live buyer /signin in my Chrome showed the new
  "not a buyer account" screen (session from a seller/admin account), which had no way out. Added a Sign out button
  and account-neutral copy to wrong-role screens on buyer (signin + RequireAuth) and seller (RequireSupplier).
  Firebase has 1 Google user so far. Branch fix/wrong-role-signout.
- 2026-11-04 IST: User chose NEXT STEP "mobile app Google sign-in". Branch feat/mobile-google-signin. Firebase Android
  app already had the debug keystore SHA-1 (5e8f...f625); downloaded fresh google-services.json and
  GoogleService-Info.plist via Firebase Management API with gcloud (both gitignored, local only). Added
  @react-native-google-signin/google-signin 17 (Firebase-mode config plugin), src/lib/googleAuth.ts (web client
  5ibngc...), sign-in screen: Continue with Google first, "Use mobile number instead" second (billing-not-enabled
  mapped to a clear message), sign-out also signs out of Google, profiles show email when no phone, checkout
  requires a contact phone. Needs a native rebuild (expo run:android). Claude in Chrome was not connected.
- 2026-11-04 IST: Native Android build NOT verified yet. Code typechecks. Problems hit: emulator Pixel_8 first stuck
  "offline" (fixed by cold boot -no-snapshot); Gradle could not delete build folders inside node_modules because the
  repo lives in OneDrive (cleared 22 stale Gradle build dirs, only folders next to a build.gradle). Then Claude Code
  stopped both the emulator and the clean Gradle build because the laptop ran low on memory. NEXT: when the user says
  so, run the build alone (no emulator), e.g. `cd apps/mobile/android && ./gradlew assembleDebug`, then boot the
  emulator and install; test Google sign-in + phone test number. If OneDrive locks continue, pause OneDrive sync or
  build from a copy outside OneDrive. Then open the PR.
- 2026-11-04 16:45 IST: Android build VERIFIED on emulator Pixel_8. OneDrive breaks Gradle (turns new build files into
  cloud placeholders: "not a regular file"), so build from a copy OUTSIDE OneDrive: robocopy apps/mobile to C:/bx/mobile
  (exclude android build dirs), then `cd C:/bx/mobile/android && ./gradlew assembleDebug --max-workers=2
  -PreactNativeArchitectures=x86_64`; run Metro from the real repo (`npx expo start`), `adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`.
  Emulator: use -no-snapshot (snapshot boot hangs "offline"), -memory 2048. Checked: new sign-in screen renders,
  Continue with Google opens Google's account flow (no DEVELOPER_ERROR, so client IDs + SHA-1 are right), mobile number
  option opens, a real number shows "Text message codes are not available yet..." (Android sends BILLING_NOT_ENABLED
  inside auth/internal-error, now handled). NOT checked: finishing a Google sign-in (needs the user's Google account on
  the emulator) and the checkout phone step. PR opened for the user to merge.
- 2026-11-04 18:00 IST: Emulator too heavy for this laptop (Google sign-in page stuck rendering, ~1.7 GB free). Built a
  standalone release APK for real phones instead: in C:/bx/mobile/android, `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://buildx-api.onrender.com
  ./gradlew assembleRelease --max-workers=2 -PreactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a` (apps/mobile/.env points at
  10.0.2.2:4000 = emulator-local API, so the env var override matters). Verified: bundle has the live API URL and new
  sign-in screen, signed with SHA-1 5e8f...f625 (registered in Firebase). Copied to Desktop/BuildX/BuildX-test.apk
  (not in git). Waiting for the user to install it on their Android phone and try Continue with Google.
- 2026-11-04 18:12 IST: User: Google sign-in "not happening" on their phone. Firebase showed their Google account signed in
  at 18:06, so Google worked; the API /auth/sync failed (Render free host asleep, app timeout 15s) and the app stayed on
  the sign-in screen silently. Fix (pushed to PR #52): sync waits 60s and retries once, sign-in screen shows a
  "Try again" / "Use a different account" box (auth.store syncError). New APK at Desktop/BuildX/BuildX-test.apk.
  NEXT: user installs it and confirms; then user merges PR #52.
- 2026-11-04 18:30 IST: Still spinning on the user's phone (Google sign-in at 18:14, API awake). Root cause (old bug):
  AuthGate in app/_layout.tsx never navigated out of (auth) for onboarded users (every branch required !inAuth), so
  set-up accounts stayed on the sign-in screen after both Google and OTP sign-in. Fixed: route each role to its home
  whenever it is outside its group (also removed the 2 old typed-route TS errors). Reading the user's DB record was
  blocked by the permission classifier (not attempted further). New APK at Desktop/BuildX/BuildX-test.apk.
- 2026-11-04 18:40 IST: User installed the 18:17 APK: sign-in works. Updated CURRENT STATE / NEXT STEPS.
- 2026-11-04 18:45 IST: Found PR #52 was squash-merged at 17:19 before the 3 fixes; opened follow-up PR from origin/main.
- 2026-11-04 IST: Mobile pass 2 started, branch feat/mobile-hivis-2. Foundation: brand fonts (Bricolage Grotesque,
  Geist, Geist Mono, Instrument Serif italic; OFL, TTFs + licences in apps/mobile/assets/fonts, loaded in
  app/_layout.tsx via useFonts under the names in src/constants/typography.ts `Font`), @expo/vector-icons
  (MaterialCommunityIcons = Material family like the websites) and react-native-svg (needs native rebuild).
  ui.tsx: Icon, BuildXMark (real roof logo), Notice (replaces error/success Alerts), ConfirmSheet (replaces confirm
  Alerts), EmptyState, ScreenHeader, TabItem icons. Codemod: 419 StyleSheet text styles -> Font.* (fontWeight
  dropped; Android ignores custom fonts with fontWeight). npm installs need --legacy-peer-deps (old react-dom peer clash).
  Next: per-role screens (emoji -> Icon, Alert -> Notice/ConfirmSheet), then a phone test APK.
- 2026-11-04 IST: Mobile pass 2, buyer side done on feat/mobile-hivis-2: cart, checkout, orders, order detail,
  order placed, products, product detail, search, review, AI chat, buyer profile; shared Profile pieces for all 4
  roles. Fixed along the way: hard-coded "Delivery FREE" (now the server's deliveryCharge), timeline missing
  IN_TRANSIT, product min order qty ignored, "+GST" shown for GST-inclusive prices, description never shown,
  "Add anyway" for a second supplier (API refuses mixed carts: now asks to start a new cart; cart warns and blocks
  checkout when the AI assistant mixed suppliers), dead profile buttons removed, "Popular searches" -> "Try searching for".
  Next: driver (available, deliveries, order), supplier (home, orders, products, add/edit, analytics), ops
  (attention, orders, order, suppliers), onboarding role, OTP screen; then build a phone APK for the user.
- 2026-11-04 19:10 IST: Mobile pass 2 code COMPLETE on feat/mobile-hivis-2 (all pushed): supplier (home, orders with
  ChoiceSheet/ConfirmSheet, products with photos + plain status names, shared src/components/ProductForm.tsx for
  add/edit matching API rules incl. GST 0%, draft, full fields on edit via GET /suppliers/me/products/:id, sales),
  driver (pickups, deliveries, order: list now sends on-the-way/delivered/cash steps to the order screen so cash is
  always recorded; Route component), ops (suppliers, order: Notice + cancel sheet, attention), onboarding (name
  prefilled from Google, "Use a different account"), real logo on sign-in, app icons rendered from the logo vectors
  (assets/icon.png, android-icon-foreground/monochrome.png, adaptive bg sand). Zero emojis and zero Alert.alert left.
  Typecheck clean. Building a phone APK now (C:/bx/mobile, prebuild regenerated for icons/svg).
  NEXT: user installs APK and checks; open PR feat/mobile-hivis-2 for the user to merge.
- 2026-11-04 19:40 IST: Redesign APK built (PR #54 branch) and copied to Desktop/BuildX/BuildX-test.apk. Build notes:
  run gradle in the foreground (the idle-memory reaper kills background builds), skip lint
  (`-x lintVitalRelease -x lintVitalAnalyzeRelease`) and use -Xmx1536m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=640m (384m ran out).
  Verified: live API URL, new screens and fonts in the bundle, signed with SHA-1 5e8f...f625.
  NEXT: user installs and checks the redesign on their phone, then merges PR #54.
- 2026-11-04 21:30 IST: User merged PR #54. OneDrive still showed 4 GB: local OneDrive is 0.43 GB, the rest is the
  OneDrive online recycle bin (deleted files count for 30 days); told the user to empty it themselves.
  Fix on branch fix/ai-one-supplier: AI price list pre-selects the supplier covering most items; "Add selected to
  cart" refuses picks from several suppliers or a cart holding another supplier, with a plain explanation.
  Typecheck clean (in C:/bx/mobile).
- 2026-11-04 22:55 IST: User: do everything that is free; DB credentials and a government sign-in method come later;
  they will buy a domain; asked about separate buyer and seller apps. Decided: one codebase, two apps (Swiggy/Zomato
  pattern): "BuildX" com.buildx.app (buyers) and "BuildX Partner" com.buildx.partner (suppliers, delivery partners,
  ops). Branch feat/partner-app:
  - apps/mobile/app.config.ts picks the variant from APP_VARIANT=partner (name, package, scheme, icon, extra.appVariant).
    src/lib/appVariant.ts: IS_PARTNER, roleBelongsHere(). AuthGate sends an account opened in the wrong app to
    (auth)/other-app ("Please use BuildX Partner" + Use a different account). Onboarding shows only this app's roles.
  - Firebase: registered Android app com.buildx.partner (1:1054722710633:android:2ced70d7255ece14b696f8) with debug
    SHA-1 5e8f...f625; new google-services.json holds both packages (gitignored; copy in buildx-secrets/firebase/
    and C:/bx/mobile). iOS partner build would need its own GoogleService-Info.plist (not done, no iOS builds yet).
  - Push: Android 13 notification permission requested; notifications that arrive while the app is open now show an
    in-app banner (src/components/AlertBanner.tsx), they were silently dropped before; taps open the order screen.
  - API push texts: emojis and em dash removed.
  - .github/workflows/keep-api-awake.yml pings /health every 10 min (free; Render gives 750 h/month).
  - Partner icons: ink background, sand mark, lime bar (assets/partner, make-icons.cjs needs sharp).
  Build: in C:/bx/mobile run `APP_VARIANT=partner npx expo prebuild -p android --clean --no-install` then gradle.
- 2026-11-04 23:05 IST: Built and verified both APKs from C:/bx/mobile (includes PR #55 and #56 changes):
  C:/dev/BuildX/BuildX.apk (com.buildx.app) and C:/dev/BuildX/BuildX-Partner.apk (com.buildx.partner), both live API,
  SHA-1 5e8f...f625, partner has POST_NOTIFICATIONS. Old BuildX-test.apk removed. The user's Google account is a
  seller, so it now belongs in BuildX Partner (BuildX shows the "use BuildX Partner" screen).
  Domains (RDAP check): buildx.in, buildx.co.in, buildx.com, buildx.store are taken; free: buildxapp.in, getbuildx.in,
  getbuildx.com, buildxapp.com, usebuildx.com, buildxhq.com/.in. Waiting for the user to buy one (money).
  Waiting on user: MongoDB credentials (they will send), government sign-in method later (likely DigiLocker /
  Aadhaar based: decide when they give details), support email/phone/legal name for the websites.
- 2026-11-04 23:40 IST: User looked for a new company name (Sthambha, Mestrikart, Plinthkart etc. were free) and
  chose getbuildx.com (brand stays BuildX). Not bought yet. Code needs no change (all URLs come from env). Added the
  four getbuildx.com hosts to Firebase authorized domains. Plan in "DOMAIN PLAN" above.
- 2026-11-05 01:55 IST: BRAND RENAMED BuildX -> Sthiva (user decision). Name research: buildx.in/.com taken, BuildX
  Technologies Pvt Ltd (Gujarat, 2026) and BuildX.Homes (Bangalore construction) make "BuildX Pvt Ltd" unlikely at MCA.
  Sthiva: sthiva.com/.in free, no company or trademark found; similar: Sthira Technovations (Dharwad), Sthir-X Systems
  (Bangalore). User to register "Sthiva Private Limited" (backup Setuzo/Udvora) and buy sthiva.com.
  Branch feat/sthiva (includes feat/partner-app #56 and the domain-plan log #57):
  - Every user-facing BuildX -> Sthiva; packages @buildx/* -> @sthiva/*; BuildXLogo/BuildXMark -> SthivaLogo/SthivaMark;
    storage keys sthiva.*; apps "Sthiva" com.sthiva.app and "Sthiva Partner" com.sthiva.partner (registered in Firebase
    with SHA-1 5e8f...; google-services.json now holds 4 packages). Firebase project display name "Sthiva".
  - KEPT on purpose (live services/data): MongoDB dbName 'buildx', Cloudinary cloud/folder buildx, buildx-15494 Firebase
    project id, buildx-api.onrender.com, buildx-vgud/48kc/ops Vercel URLs, GitHub repo name buildx, logger service name.
  - New logo: S of two solid blocks with a lime beam (packages/web-core/src/brand/SthivaLogo.tsx; mobile ui.tsx;
    favicons apps/*/app/icon.svg; app icons via apps/mobile/scripts/make-icons.cjs). Wordmark "sthiva" in the display font,
    tagline "SOLID MATERIALS, STEADY SUPPLY".
  - Checks: API tsc + 288 tests + build, web-core 81 tests, buyer/seller typecheck, mobile tsc all pass.
  - GitHub contributors: only Harishrs2006 and Shubb07; no Claude trailers on any remote branch. Old LOCAL backup
    branches (backup/local-main-old, backup/stash-main-lockfile, feat/pincode-lookup, feat/rn-mongodb-rewrite) contain
    Claude trailers but were never pushed; do not push them.
- 2026-11-05 02:20 IST: User merged #58. Vercel (3 sites) and Render redeployed; all show Sthiva, CI green, API healthy.
  Checked the live home page in Chrome: new S mark and "sthiva" wordmark render correctly. First Sthiva-Partner build
  still said BuildX (copy to C:/bx failed silently); fixed copy, re-typechecked, rebuilt: bundle now has "Sthiva Partner".
- 2026-11-05 IST: User supplied the real Sthiva logo (yellow rounded tile, S of two halves: top ink, bottom white).
  Saved to docs/brand/sthiva-logo-original.png (+ user-brief/images). Vectorised exactly (two arcs r270/r90, centres
  588,588 and 948,948 on the 1536 canvas; 180 px edge difference vs the PNG). Replaced my S mark everywhere:
  web-core SthivaLogo/SthivaMark (tile + "sthiva" wordmark), favicons, OG image, mobile SthivaMark, app icons
  (buyer: yellow bg, ink/white S, adaptive bg #F3B806; partner: ink bg, yellow/white S). Brand accent lime -> logo
  yellow #F3B806 (deep #D49E00, soft #FDF0C4) in all tailwind configs, globals.css, mobile colors, design doc.
- 2026-11-05 02:45 IST: User merged #59 and #60. Vercel production deploys of #60 failed: daily deployment limit on the
  free plan (too many branch pushes today). APKs rebuilt with the owner's logo and verified: C:/dev/BuildX/Sthiva.apk
  (com.sthiva.app) and Sthiva-Partner.apk (com.sthiva.partner); bundles contain Sthiva and #F3B806.
- 2026-11-04 IST (launch prep, branch feat/launch-ready in worktree C:\Users\Harish\buildx-launch, outside OneDrive):
  User asked to get everything ready for a real launch BEFORE paying for anything. Done so far:
  SECURITY: Firebase test number +917019282019 no longer uses the public code 123456 (it was in this public log).
  New private code is ONLY in C:/dev/BuildX/buildx-secrets/TEST_SIGNIN.txt (outside the repo). Admin test number
  untouched. STOREFRONT: real page titles for product, category and material pages (server layouts with
  generateMetadata; product title fetched from the API with a 4 s timeout, generic title if the API is asleep);
  sitemap now lists 10 categories, every material guide and every live product, drops /signin; search fixes typos
  and trade words (cemnt -> cement, saria -> TMT) and shows matching material guides above supplier listings
  (packages/web-core/src/catalog/search.ts + 6 tests, 87 web-core tests pass); phone buy bar on the product page
  (price + Add to cart, hides when the real button is on screen, turns into View cart after adding).
  Verified on a local production build at 375 px through a read-only local CORS proxy (Render CORS no longer allows
  localhost). Note: the other session's branch feat/mobile-google-signin (mobile Google sign-in, Android build not
  verified) is untouched in the OneDrive checkout.
- 2026-11-04 IST: ACCOUNT DELETION (both app stores require it; privacy policy already promised it). API: DELETE
  /api/v1/users/me for BUYER and SUPPLIER (staff/drivers get 403, ops closes them). Refused with 409 while any order is
  open (as buyer or as supplier). Erases name/phone/email/addresses/GST/bank/avatar, firebaseUid -> deleted:<id>,
  isActive false, deletedAt set; supplier listings -> DISCONTINUED and profile inactive; orders kept (tax records);
  Firebase login deleted (user-not-found tolerated). 7 tests, API 295/295 pass. Buyer web: Account page has
  "Delete my account" with in-page confirm; public page /account-deletion (link it in the Play and App Store
  listings), linked from the footer, legal pages and sitemap. TODO: same button in seller-web and the mobile app
  (mobile is on the other session's branch feat/mobile-google-signin; add it after that merges).
- 2026-11-04 IST: apps/mobile/eas.json (preview APK, production AAB with remote version numbers, live API URL)
  and docs/LAUNCH.md (launch runbook: free owner steps, paid switches with prices, domain switch env vars,
  Play Store steps incl. SHA fingerprints, google-services.json for EAS, data safety answers). PR opened for
  feat/launch-ready. NEXT: user merges; then the paid switches in LAUNCH.md section 2 when the user says yes;
  demo supplier removal needs the user's OK; delete-account button still missing in seller-web and mobile app.
- 2026-11-05 03:00 IST: Revived PR #51 (launch prep + account deletion + LAUNCH.md + eas.json) on branch
  feat/launch-ready-sthiva: merged main, resolved 4 conflicts (imports, footer: kept main + "Delete your account"
  link), applied the Sthiva rename and yellow colour to its files. API 295 tests, web-core 87 tests, buyer and seller
  typecheck pass. Log merge had duplicated the whole file (CRLF vs LF): restored main's log and re-added #51's entries.
  Same branch: delete-account added to the seller portal (Business page) and both mobile apps (profile footer, buyers
  and suppliers only; mobile api errors now keep the HTTP status). apps/*/vercel.json ignoreCommand: websites rebuild
  only when their folder, packages/web-core or the root package files change (Vercel project roots are apps/<name>,
  "skip unchanged" was already on). LAUNCH.md updated for the Sthiva name decision.
- 2026-11-05 IST: BRAND SYSTEM v2 (user sent 5 reference logos: hexagon split by an S, "STHIVA PARTNER / SELLER
  PLATFORM", block-S tile; refs in user-brief/images/logo-research). Decision (one master mark, two colourways, like
  Swiggy/Swiggy Partner): pointy-top hexagon (bolt head) split by a point-symmetric S into two halves (buyer + seller).
  Sharp corners so the S gap cuts cleanly through the edges (rounded corners left slivers; a vertex-to-vertex S broke
  the outline: both tried and rejected). Wordmark: Geist Bold outlines, 0.16em tracking; PARTNER Geist SemiBold 0.36em.
  Sthiva: ink+yellow mark, ink word (white on dark); app icon yellow tile, ink/white mark. Sthiva Partner: white+yellow
  mark on ink, PARTNER in yellow; app icon ink tile. Kit + generator: docs/brand (node docs/brand/generate.cjs
  docs/brand with BRAND_NODE_MODULES pointing at sharp + opentype.js). Code: web-core brand/paths.ts (generated) +
  SthivaLogo (partner prop, SVG mask with useId), seller portal uses the partner lockup + partner favicon, OG image
  uses an SVG data URI, mobile src/constants/brand.ts copy + SthivaMark (react-native-svg Mask; tile follows the app
  variant), app icons via apps/mobile/scripts/make-icons.cjs. Checked the real component on a local dev server.
- 2026-11-05 IST: OVER-THE-AIR UPDATES (EAS Update). Expo account is "hatish_r_s" (with a t; user typed harish_r_s).
  User logged in eas-cli on this laptop themselves. Project @hatish_r_s/sthiva, id 26067cb1-d12d-4279-9bda-bb3fc6f6eca3
  (app.config.ts EAS_PROJECT_ID). expo-updates ~56.0.28; runtimeVersion policy appVersion (bump app.json version for
  native changes); channels buyer-production / partner-production via updates.requestHeaders (works with our local
  gradle builds). Publish: from apps/mobile `npm run update:buyer -- "note"` / `npm run update:partner -- "note"`
  (scripts/publish-update.cjs sets live API URL + variant). UpdateBanner: "A new version is ready. Tap to restart.";
  profile footer shows "update <id>" when running an OTA update.
  User created the Expo organisation "sthiva" and transferred the project: now @sthiva/sthiva (same id). app.config.ts
  owner: 'sthiva'. Personal Expo usernames cannot be renamed (the typo account hatish_r_s stays as the login).
- 2026-11-05 07:50 IST: User pasted the full Sthiva business model (buyer, supplier, delivery partner, admin). Audited
  the code against it: docs/PLATFORM_CHECKLIST.md (DONE/PART/TODO + 8 phases). User answered the 4 business rules
  (see NEXT STEPS). Phase 1 built: Category.commission (percent, Sthiva-delivers / supplier-delivers), VehicleType model
  (code, name, maxLoadKg, baseFare, perKmRate), PlatformSettings (offerTimeoutMinutes, null = off), pure rates.ts
  (commissionPercent, commissionPaise, pickVehicle, deliveryChargePaise; integer paise). API: GET /ops/settings
  (ops), PATCH /ops/settings/commission/:id, POST+PATCH /ops/settings/vehicles, PATCH /ops/settings/general (ADMIN).
  Ops console: new Settings tab. 304 API tests pass (9 new), API + ops typecheck clean. No default numbers anywhere.
- 2026-11-05 07:20 IST: GitHub sidebar still listed "claude" as contributor (stale cache; API and history are clean).
  Toggled default branch main -> tmp-refresh -> main to force a recount; added local commit-msg hook that blocks
  Claude/AI co-author lines. If still shown, user asks GitHub Support to refresh the contributors cache.
- 2026-11-05 08:20 IST: User merged #66. Phase 2 on feat/catalog-items: CatalogItem model (name, brand, category, unit,
  weightKgPerUnit, needsReview, mergedInto); Product.catalogItemId (one listing per item per supplier, partial unique
  index). Supplier create: pick catalogItemId, or auto-match by normalised name + category + unit, or a new item
  (needsReview). Startup linkUnlinkedProducts() links old listings. API: GET /suppliers/me/catalog; ops GET/POST
  /ops/catalog, GET/PATCH /ops/catalog/:id, POST /ops/catalog/:id/merge. SupplierProfile.canDeliver. Seller web:
  "Already on Sthiva" suggestions in the product form, delivery choice in setup; ops console: Catalog tab.
  316 API tests pass (12 new), both sites build. Note: Python here defaults to cp1252: always pass encoding='utf-8'.
- 2026-11-05 08:25 IST: User merged #67. Phase 3 on feat/supplier-offers: new orders are PENDING with
  allocation {state OFFERED|ACCEPTED|NEEDS_OPS, expiresAt, attempts[]}; order items carry catalogItemId.
  allocation.service.ts: acceptOffer, rejectOffer (reason), expireOverdueOffers (60 s sweeper in server.ts, uses
  admin offerTimeoutMinutes; off = never expires), opsOfferTo (any supplier with stock, no price rule), opsFindNext.
  Next supplier = verified/active, serves PIN, lists every item with stock, not tried before, line price <= buyer
  line price; cheapest first. Stock moves with the offer; NEEDS_OPS holds none (inventoryState NONE). Buyer view
  hides allocation + supplier reasons. Seller web + Partner app: Accept/Reject; ops: Needs a supplier queue and
  supplier options panel. 324 API tests pass (8 new); 3 sites build; mobile typechecks.
- 2026-11-05 08:35 IST: User merged #68. OTA publish failed: new eas-cli needs --environment in --non-interactive mode.
  Added '--environment production' to scripts/publish-update.cjs (copied to C:/bx/mobile).
- 2026-11-05 08:50 IST: User merged #69. Phase 4 on feat/one-price: commission.ts (ratesFor, addPercent,
  buyerProduct, payoutFor, supplierEarnings). Buyer price = supplier listed price x (1 + "Sthiva delivers" %);
  supplier earns their listed price; if they deliver themselves Sthiva keeps only the lower % and the rest goes to
  them. Categories without a commission are hidden and can't be ordered. /products shows one entry per catalog item
  (cheapest eligible listing, sellerCount), prices with commission; AI estimate too. Orders: Sthiva picks the
  cheapest supplier that has the whole cart and serves the PIN; items store supplierUnitPrice, supplierLineTotal,
  commissionPercent, supplierDeliveryPercent; order supplierTotal + commissionTotal. Re-offer compares with the
  supplier side. Supplier order list + ops order detail return earnings. Buyer web/app carts can mix listings.
  332 API tests pass (8 new); 3 sites build; mobile typechecks.
- 2026-11-05 09:20 IST: Phase 5a on feat/delivery-pricing: delivery-pricing.ts (straight-line km supplier
  location -> pinned point or delivery PIN post office; weight from CatalogItem.weightKgPerUnit; smallest vehicle;
  charge = base + perKm x km). OFF until a vehicle type exists; when ON, unpriceable orders are refused with
  DELIVERY_NOT_PRICED. Supplier choice ranks goods + delivery. Order.delivery {vehicle, weightKg, distanceKm,
  driverSharePercent}; total includes delivery. Earnings: supplier keeps full charge when self-delivering; driver

- 2026-11-05 09:50 IST: Phase 5b on feat/driver-offers: driver-offers.ts (rank: verified, active, on duty, vehicle
  capacity >= weight, not tried; smallest vehicle then fewest jobs; no GPS yet), Order.driverOffer {state OFFERED|
  ASSIGNED|NEEDS_OPS, attempts}, driverOfferTimeoutMinutes setting + sweeper. Supplier dispatch starts offers; driver
  accept/decline; ops assign closes offers; ops unassign re-offers. Orders before offers stay open to any verified
  driver. Order.deliveryOtp (4 digits, select:false) shown to buyer until delivered; driver/supplier must send it to
  mark DELIVERED; 5 wrong tries lock; ops /deliver confirms without it. deliveryIssue reports (driver/supplier) ->
  ops "Delivery problem" queue -> resolve-problem. UI: ops queues/actions/settings, seller code + problem, buyer web
  + app show code, Partner app Accept/Decline + code + problem. 349 API tests pass (10 new); 3 sites build.
- 2026-11-05 17:30 IST: DOMAIN sthiva.com bought by the user on Cloudflare and connected:
  - Vercel domains: buildx-vgud gets www.sthiva.com (primary) + sthiva.com (308 to www); buildx-48kc gets
    seller.sthiva.com; buildx-ops gets ops.sthiva.com. Old *.vercel.app URLs still work.
  - Cloudflare DNS (all DNS only, not proxied): @ and www CNAME 48ebdc9dc4500567.vercel-dns-017.com,
    seller CNAME 685c82bf411f661b.vercel-dns-017.com, ops CNAME 8e7f76325dd7bc05.vercel-dns-017.com,
    api CNAME buildx-api.onrender.com.
  - Render: api.sthiva.com custom domain verified, HTTPS works (/health 200). FRONTEND_URL now also allows
    https://sthiva.com, www., seller., ops. (old vercel.app origins kept); API redeployed.
  - Vercel buyer env: NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.sthiva.com (new), NEXT_PUBLIC_SELLER_PORTAL_URL=
    https://seller.sthiva.com (deleted + re-added; editing needs an email code). NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL left on onrender.
  - Code (branch feat/sthiva-domain): buyer site.ts default URL, mobile home WEB_URL, eas.json and
    publish-update.cjs now use https://api.sthiva.com and https://www.sthiva.com.
  - PR #72 (phase 5b) was merged by the user.
- 2026-11-05 20:15 IST: PHASE 6 settlements (branch feat/settlements). User merged #73 (domain).
  - Settlement model (ST-yymmdd-xxxxxx): one supplier or driver, order lines (earned, cash kept), totals, net
    (positive = Sthiva pays them, negative = they pay Sthiva), PENDING -> PAID (reference) or CANCELLED (frees orders).
  - Orders count once DELIVERED and cash confirmed (CAPTURED/PARTIAL); Order.supplierSettlementId / driverSettlementId
    stop double counting (claimed in a transaction). Earnings reuse commission.ts: supplier expectedPayout by
    delivery mode, driver = driverSharePercent of the delivery charge. Cash kept = codAmountCollected when the
    supplier or the assigned driver confirmed it; ops-recorded cash counts as Sthiva's.
  - API: GET /ops/settlements/balances?party, GET /ops/settlements, GET /ops/settlements/:id (operators);
    POST /ops/settlements, /:id/paid, /:id/cancel (ADMIN). GET /suppliers/me/settlements, /delivery/me/settlements.
  - UI: ops console Payouts tab; seller website Payouts tab; Sthiva Partner app Payouts tab (supplier and driver).
  - No payment schedule invented: an admin settles whenever they choose. 355 API tests pass (6 new); ops and
    seller sites build; mobile tsc clean.
- 2026-11-05 22:45 IST: PHASE 7 admin analytics + people (branch feat/admin-analytics, stacked on feat/settlements #74).
  - GET /ops/analytics?days=7|30|90 (IST days): placed, cancelled (by who), delivered, sales, supplier and driver
    earnings, Sthiva share (sales - partner earnings, via settlement orderAmounts), daily series, top 10 items,
    supplier and driver offer answers (offers/took/rejected/no answer, accept %) and deliveries.
  - GET /ops/users?role&q&page: every account (deleted hidden), regex-safe search on name/email/phone, buyer order counts.
    Suspend/reinstate uses the existing ADMIN-only PATCH /ops/users/:id/active (reason required).
  - Ops console: Insights tab (stat tiles, sales-per-day bar chart with hover + table view, top items, supplier and
    driver tables) and People tab. Desktop tabs show icons only below xl; phone tab bar scrolls.
  - 359 API tests pass (4 new); ops site builds. Not yet seen in a browser with real data (needs ops sign-in).
- 2026-11-05 23:15 IST: User merged #74 and #75. #75 had been merged into feat/settlements, but #74's squash already
  included it, so main has phase 7 (empty PR #76 closed).
- 2026-11-05 23:20 IST: PHASE 8 Sthiva Driver app (branch feat/driver-app).
  - APP_VARIANT=driver -> "Sthiva Driver", com.sthiva.driver, scheme sthivadriver, EAS channel driver-production,
    icon assets/driver (light tile, ink + yellow S; scripts/make-icons.cjs), adaptive bg #FAF8F3.
  - src/lib/appVariant.ts: buyer | partner | driver. Driver app accepts only DELIVERY_PARTNER accounts and onboards
    only drivers; other accounts see the other-app screen naming the right app. Sthiva Partner still serves drivers.
  - Firebase: Android app com.sthiva.driver registered (app id 1:1054722710633:android:cde8c73c8e6f50c8b696f8),
    SHA-1 5e8f...f625; Google created its Android OAuth client. Local google-services.json (gitignored) now has 5
    packages; copy in buildx-secrets/firebase.
  - publish-update.cjs and npm run update:driver handle the driver channel.
  - Built C:/dev/BuildX/Sthiva-Driver.apk (not in git): package com.sthiva.driver, label Sthiva Driver, signed
    5e8f...f625, bundle uses https://api.sthiva.com, appVariant driver. NOTE: C:/bx/mobile/android is now prebuilt
    for the driver variant; run `APP_VARIANT=<variant> npx expo prebuild -p android --clean --no-install` before
    building another app.
- 2026-11-05 23:30 IST: User merged #77 (phase 8). Polish branch chore/polish:
  - Supplier orders show straight-line km from the supplier's pickup point (stored delivery distance, else address or
    PIN post office); seller website + Partner app.
  - Ops Settings: Categories section (add, rename, order, show/hide; slug fixed). Hidden categories are now off sale
    in listings and orders (isActive checked in sellableCategoryIds and ratesFor).
  - Vercel ignored-build step was already in place. Session log CURRENT STATE / NEXT STEPS rewritten.
  - 363 API tests pass (2 new files + 1 settings test); ops and seller sites build; mobile tsc clean.
